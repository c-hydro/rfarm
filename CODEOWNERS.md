# CODEOWNERS

This file defines the owners responsible for specific parts of the repository.

## Repository Ownership

You can assign individuals or teams as code owners.  
Code owners automatically receive review requests when someone opens a pull request that modifies files they own.

### Example

```text
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names.
# The following assigns ownership of all files in the repository:
* @fabiodelogu
```

### Notes

- Code owners must have **write** permissions in the repository.  
- Patterns follow the same syntax used in `.gitignore` files.  
- You can define ownership per folder or file as needed.
